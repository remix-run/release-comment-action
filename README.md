# release-comment-action

A GitHub Action to automatically comment on Pull Requests and related issues about a release. Used by [Remix][remix] and [React Router][react_router].

## Usage

Basic usage can be enabled simply by using the following.

```yaml
- name: üìù Comment on related issues and pull requests
  uses: remix-run/release-comment-action@0.4.1
```

This covers a lot of use cases, even this repo uses this set up, however in a monorepo set up you may want to to follow a specific package (like `remix`, or `react-router`). In those situations the following can be used to filter on only the `remix` tag and only commits that affect the `./packages` directory.

```yaml
- name: üìù Comment on related issues and pull requests
  uses: remix-run/release-comment-action@0.4.1
  with:
    DIRECTORY_TO_CHECK: "./packages"
    PACKAGE_VERSION_TO_FOLLOW: "remix"
```
